Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:


Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:
1) Apply shift to the text
2) Split the shifted text
3) If the first value is a word,
    3a) First tuple is (0, shift amount)
    3b) Recursively call function again with start position as len(first word) + 1
4) Else
    4a) Increase the shift amount by 1
